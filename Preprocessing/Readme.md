## Preprocessing timeline:
- **February 3, 2024** : Initail preprocessing using direct methods like pixel differencing.
- **February 9, 2024** : Exploration of other preprocessing methods like feature extraction using CNN and image transformation methods to overcome alignment issues.
- **February 10,2024** : Exploring more on Convolution feature extraction methods. Tried out new Kernel iteration technique.
